# Notific — SwiftUI Local Notification Scheduler

Notifier is a simple SwiftUI application that lets you schedule local notifications on iOS devices.  
It supports two trigger modes — after a selected number of seconds, or at a specific date and time.

## Features

- Schedule notifications using:
  - **Time Interval** (after N seconds)
  - **Calendar Date** (specific date & time)
- Clean and minimal SwiftUI interface
- Customizable title and body fields
- **Clear All** button to reset all inputs
- Notification scheduling using the `UserNotifications` framework
